# Project : Simple Calculator 
### Overview of the project:
 The purpose of this Python program is to implement a simple calculator that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations.
 The program will prompt the user for two numerical inputs and then provide an option to choose one of the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
 After the operation is selected, the program will perform the calculation and display the result to the user.

 ### Objective:

#1. User Input Handling:<br>
       Prompt the user to enter two numbers (floating-point or integer values).<br>
       Ensure that the input is valid (e.g., checking for non-numeric values and handling division by zero).<br>
#2.Operation Selection:
       Allow the user to choose from four operations:<br>
       Addition (+)<br>
       Subtraction (-)<br>
       Multiplication (*)<br>
       Division (/)<br>
       Use an appropriate method to capture the user's choice (e.g., numeric input for selecting the operation).<br>
 #3.Perform the Calculation:<br>
      Based on the userâ€™s choice, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation on the two input numbers.<br>
      Handle any potential errors, such as dividing by zero, gracefully (e.g., display an error message).<br>
#4.Display the Result:<br>
      Show the result of the chosen operation to the user in a clear and understandable format.<br>
      Allow the user to see the outcome and confirm the operation was executed correctly.
